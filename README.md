# Permutations-Exercise

This exercise uses a hypothetical situation of a vaccine clinical trial in order to predict the number of samples needed to reach a 90% significance threshold (alpha = 0.05). Fischer permutations are used to solve this problem given known a probability of disease with the vaccine and a known probability of disease without the vaccine.
