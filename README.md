# Permutations-Exercise

This exercise uses a hypothetical situation of a vaccine clinical trial in order to predict the number of samples needed to reach a 90% significance threshold (alpha = 0.05). Fischer permutations are used to solve this problem given known a probability of disease upon exposure for those with the vaccine and without the vaccine.
